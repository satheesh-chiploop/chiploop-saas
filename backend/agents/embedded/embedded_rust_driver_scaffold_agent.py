TASK:
Generate driver scaffold, init, basic read/write APIs.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output MUST be RAW RUST ONLY (no markdown fences, no prose).
- This file is a Rust MODULE, not crate root.
- DO NOT generate crate attributes:
  - NO #![no_std]
  - NO #![allow(...)]
  - NO #![feature(...)]
- Assume crate configuration exists in lib.rs or main.rs.
- Put assumptions only as Rust comments:
  // ASSUMPTION: ...
- Code must compile when included via:
  mod driver_scaffold;
- Write to: firmware/drivers/driver_scaffold.rs
