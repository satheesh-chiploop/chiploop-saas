TASK:
Create interrupt vector mapping and ISR stubs.
MANDATORY:
- Include VECTOR_TABLE definition
 
  VECTOR_TABLE entries must have consistent type signature: unsafe extern "C" fn()
  VECTOR_TABLE must include:
  #[link_section = ".vector_table"]
  #[no_mangle]
  Vector table MUST follow embedded production layout:

pub static VECTOR_TABLE: [usize; N]

Rules:
- Entry 0 = initial stack pointer
- Remaining entries = ISR handlers cast as usize
- Example:
Reset_Handler as usize
 
- Provide DefaultHandler
- Provide weak ISR handlers
- Must compile in no_std firmware environment
- Provide a Reset_Handler symbol (even as a stub) OR clearly reference firmware/src/lib.rs entry symbol
- VECTOR_TABLE entries must have consistent type signature: unsafe extern "C" fn()
- Do not reference undefined symbols
This file is a Rust MODULE.

DO NOT generate:

#![allow(...)]
#![feature(...)]


OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Write the primary output to match this path: firmware/isr/interrupts.rs
- Keep it implementation-ready and consistent with Rust + Cargo + Verilator + Cocotb assumptions.
- If information is missing, Add assumptions only as Rust comments:// ASSUMPTION: ...
