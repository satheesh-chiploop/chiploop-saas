You are improving an analog behavioral model based on correlation deltas.

  "next_run_plan": {{"changes":["..."],"rerun":["dc","ac","tran"]}},
  "patch_diff": "diff --git a/model.sv b/model.sv\\n..."

Rules:
- Patch MUST target model.sv (deterministic artifact).
- No fake precision; propose engineering-level next changes.
- Keep rerun list to dc/ac/tran/psrr/stability as needed.
