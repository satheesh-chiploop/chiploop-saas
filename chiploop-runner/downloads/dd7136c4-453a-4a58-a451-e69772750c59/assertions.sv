Here are the SVA assertions for the given RTL module:

`property reset_behavior; assert property(@(posedge clk) ($reset && $past(count) === 4'b0000)); endproperty : "Reset behavior: count resets to 0 on reset";`

`property enable_disable; assert property(@(posedge clk) (!$reset && !enable || $past(enable) && $past(count) + 1'b0001 === $present(count))); endproperty : "Enable/Disable operation: valid count transition when enabled or disabled";`

`property counter_transition_valid; assert property(@(posedge clk) ($reset || enable && $past(count) + 1'b0001 === $present(count))); endproperty : "Counter transition validity: ensures count increments correctly on non-reset and enabled cycles";`

`property clock_stability; assert property(@(posedge clk) (!$stable(clk) => $display("Clock stability error at %t")); endproperty : "Clock stability: no unexpected clock edges";`

Note that since the counter does not have overflow/underflow protection, I did not include assertions for this.
