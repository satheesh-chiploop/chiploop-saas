Here are the SVA assertions to verify the RTL module:

```
assert property (@(posedge clk)) reset_behavior:
$display("Reset assertion failed: counter should be reset to 0 when reset is high");

assert property (@(posedge clk)) enable_disable_operation:
$display("Enable/Disable operation assertion failed: counter should not increment when disable is high or reset is low");

assert property (@(posedge clk)) transition_validity:
$display("Transition validity assertion failed: invalid state transition detected in the counter");

assert property (@(posedge clk)) clock_stability:
$display("Clock stability assertion failed: multiple clock edges detected within a single clock period");

`default_clocking @(posedge clk)

assert property (disable_cover) overflow_underflow_protection:
$display("Overflow/Underflow protection assertion failed: count value exceeds 4-bit counter capacity");
```

Note that the `clock_stability` assertion is not applicable in this case since there's no explicit clock edge detection logic. If you want to verify clock stability, you'd need to add a separate clock detector or use a more advanced SVA construct like clock domain crossing (CDC) verification.

The `overflow_underflow_protection` assertion is also not directly applicable here since the counter only increments up to 15 and there's no explicit overflow detection logic. However, if you want to verify that the count value remains within the valid range, you can modify this assertion accordingly.
