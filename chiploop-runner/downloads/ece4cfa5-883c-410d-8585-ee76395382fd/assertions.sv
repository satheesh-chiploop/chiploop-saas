Here are the SVA assertions to verify the behavior of the `counter_4b` module:
```
assert property (@(posedge clk) reset_behavior: $rose(reset) |=> ($stable(q) == 0));
"Reset asserted, counter should be set to 0";

assert property (@(posedge clk) enable_disable: (~reset & enable) |=> (q === q + 1));
"Enable asserted and reset disabled, counter should increment by 1";

assert property (@(posedge clk) transition_validity: (enable & ~reset) |=> ((q < 4'hf) | (q == 0)));
"Counter transitions are valid; max value is 15 (4'b1111), min value is 0";

assert property (@(posedge clk) clock_stability: !($setup(clk, 2));
"Clock signal should not have any setup or hold time violations";

assert property (@(posedge clk) overflow_protection: (~reset & enable) |=> (!((q === 4'hf) && ($rose(enable))));
"Counter should not overflow when `enable` is asserted and reset is disabled";
```
Note that I've used the `$rose`, `$stable`, and `$setup` built-in functions to simplify the assertions. Additionally, I've used the `|=>` operator to specify the implication relationship between the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of each assertion. The LHS is evaluated on every clock cycle, while the RHS is evaluated only when the LHS is true.
