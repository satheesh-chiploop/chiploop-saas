Here are some stimulus ideas and assertions for the `counter_4b` module:

**Stimulus Ideas:**

1. **Reset Stimulus**: Send a reset pulse to verify that the counter resets to zero.

`uvm_do_on(phased_reset_vseq, "reset", reset)`

2. **Incremental Counting**: Enable the counter and increment its value repeatedly.

`uvm_do_on(phased_inc_vseq, "increment_count", {enable; repeat(10) { enable_and_incr(); } })`

3. **Disable-Enable Cycle**: Disable the counter for a few clock cycles, then re-enable it to verify that it continues counting from where it left off.

`uvm_do_on(phased_disable_and_enable_vseq, "disable_and_enable", {enable; repeat(5) { disable(); }; enable() })`

**Assertions:**

1. **Count Value**: Verify that the count value is correct at various points during the stimulus sequence.

`assert_property(@0, $equal(count, 4'd0)); // reset assertion`
`assert_property(@10, $greater_or_equal(count, 4'd5)); // increment counting assertion`

2. **Counter Value after Reset**: Verify that the counter resets to zero when the reset signal is asserted.

`assert_property(@20, $equal(count, 4'd0)); // reset assertion`

3. **No Wraparound**: Verify that the counter does not wrap around during counting (assuming a maximum count of 15).

`assert_property(@30, $less_or_equal(count, 4'd14)); // no wraparound assertion`

Note: These are just examples and may need to be modified or expanded based on the specific requirements of your verification environment.
